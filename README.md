# Stick2It

A clean approach to goal setting and routine tracking. Increase your productivity and mindfulness with simple tools that promote progress and reflection. Coded in Swift using Apple's SwiftUI, designed for iPhone and iPad devices.

Koalati is more than just a to-do list. Koalati makes it easy to see not only what you have yet to do, but also all that you have done. Being proud of what you have done is just as important as knowing what you have left to do. Reflection is an essential part of mindfulness and Koalati brings reflection to the forefront with several key features.

The 'past' tab allows you to quickly see what you had accomplished yesterday, and turning your device to landscape allows you to easily see progress over the past week. The 'today' tab asks you to reflect on today and plan out tomorrow. The future tab allows you to plan out your routines and build habits.
